# lab1
Lab1 is a lab where you write the method body code for the Calculator class in Java.
You will write the following methods: 
  divide(int x, int y),
  add(int x, int y),
  subtract(int x , int y),
  multiply(int x, int y), and
  mod(int x, int y).
For each of the methods, you will write the method which returns the resulting int value specified by the method's name.
For example, in the mod method, you should find the remainder using modulus operation between x and y. 
To test your class run the Runner's main method. DO NOT affect any code in the method. If it says Calculutor class not found, restart your IDE.
